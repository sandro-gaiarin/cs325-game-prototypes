<h1>CS 325 Game Prototypes</h1>

<p>I'm making games! Some will be weird. Some will be terrible. Others may be broken. But perhaps one will be... good?

<ol>
<li><a href=https://microstudio.io/gabagoose/tutorialcreateagame/3TDEUTRP>Digital Assignment 0</a>: Tutorial game in MicroStudio. Character model is based on Gotrek from Warhammer Fantasy.</li>
<li><a href=https://microstudio.io/gabagoose/325digital1/VYBG96GW>Digital Assignment 1</a>: Game has changed since 1A. It's been adjusted to more of a top-down Zelda-like. Only one functional level, needs a hard reset after a win.</li>
<li><a href=https://microstudio.io/gabagoose/325digital2/CG2GKCDF>Digital Assignment 2</a>: SpellShaper: Blast waves of fireballs to destroy the oncoming horde of crabs! The velocity of the fireballs will depend on the distance of the mouse from the player. WASD to move, mouse click to fire.</li>
